  <p>CS3, the Intro computer survey class at Santa Monica College, is offered every semester. Several sections are 
      available. Nevertheless, the popularity of the class has meant in the past that not all students wanting to take the
      class could be admitted.  </p>   
  <p>The primary textbook for this course is <a href="">Computers, Tools for the Information Age</a> by H.L Capron</p>
